# Studio Neat's Canopy is the iPad Pro keyboard case you've been waiting for

I like Apple's Smart Keyboard for the iPad Pro. Unlike lots of people, I prefer less travel and the sort-of spongy feel fo the Smart Keyboard is perfectly useable. 

But I much prefer the feel of the Magic Keyboard. Although it's designed for the Mac, as you'd expect the Magic Keyboard works perfectly well with the iPad Pro (or indeed any iPad). Like the iPad, it charges via Lightning so you can use your iPad charger to make sure it never runs out of battery. And the feel of the keys is great, somewhere between the MacBook's shallow travel and the old-style MacBook Pro.

There's only one problem: if you want to use your Magic Keyboard with the iPad Pro then you're going to have to carry around some kind of stand. You can, of course, just use the Smart Cover and sort-of stand it up in landscape mode, but it never fills me with confidence, and you can't use it in your lap. 

The InCase Origami Workstation used to be the ideal solution. A clever cover for the old Apple Wireless Keyboard, it opened up and folded in a way which meant you could use it as a stand too. It had the advantage of protecting the keyboard when in your bag, and it also allowed you to use the iPad either in landscape or portrait - and portrait mode is great if you're bashing out a load of words and want to see a whole page's worth of content. 

Sadly though there's no Origami case for the Magic Keyboard. And this is where the Canopy comes in. Like the Origami, Canopy is a cover which wraps around the keyboard rather than the iPad. And like the Origami it folds to act as a way of propping up the iPad while you use it. Rather than a clever fold, the Canopy uses a leather strap with a press-button fastener which does double-duty by closing the cover around the keyboard and also hitching it to act as a stand. It's super-clever and, because it's using the full width of the cover as a prop, actually feels more stable when you use it in your lap than the Origami.
